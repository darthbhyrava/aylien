Testing out Aylien's Text API for sentiment analysis of tweets.

#### Overall Sentiment Analysis
Ran API calls for _21Feb\_Neg.xlsx_ (337 false postives: our sent>0, manual=Negative) and _21Feb\_Pos.xlsx_ (81 false negatives: our sent<0, manual=Positive) with accuracies of 39.4% and 9.8% respectively. IBM Watson's API is better (and more expensive).
